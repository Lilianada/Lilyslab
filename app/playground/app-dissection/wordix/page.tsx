        <NotionHeading1>Wordix: Building a Word Guessing Game</NotionHeading1>

        <NotionParagraph>
          Wordix is a browser-based word guessing game inspired by Wordle. This dissection explores the design
          decisions, technical implementation, and lessons learned while building this project.

        <NotionHeading2>Project Overview</NotionHeading2>

        <NotionParagraph>
          Wordix challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, the game provides
          feedback by coloring letters to indicate if they are correct and in the right position (green), correct but in
          the wrong position (yellow), or not in the word at all (gray).
        </NotionParagraph>

        <NotionCallout emoji="ðŸŽ¯">
          The goal was to create a clean, accessible implementation with smooth animations and a responsive design that
          works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

        <NotionHeading3>Visual Design</NotionHeading3>

        <NotionParagraph>
          I wanted Wordix to have a distinct visual identity while maintaining the familiar gameplay that makes word
          guessing games so addictive. The design uses a clean, minimalist aesthetic with a focus on typography and
          color.

        <NotionHeading3>Word List and Validation</NotionHeading3>

        <NotionParagraph>
          One of the key challenges was creating a good word list that balances challenge and fairness.

        <NotionQuote>

        <NotionHeading2>Conclusion</NotionHeading2>

        <NotionParagraph>
          Building Wordix was both challenging and rewarding. The project demonstrates how thoughtful design and
          technical implementation can create an engaging user experience even with a relatively simple concept.
        </NotionParagraph>

        <NotionParagraph>
          The focus on accessibility, performance, and user feedback resulted in a game that's enjoyable for a wide
          audience. The lessons learned will inform future projects, particularly around state management, animation,
          and accessibility implementation.
